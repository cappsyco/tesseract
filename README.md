# Tesseract

Four dimensional speed cubing.

### Current state

We're still very early in the life of this app, so features are thin on the ground. Currently we have the bare basics:

- Generate 3x3 scrambles
- Time your solves
- View your solving record and AO5, 12 and 100 from that session

### Future features

In order of priority:

- Solving record to persist (currently it will clear once the application is closed)
- Expanding the above to allow organising your solving into separate sessions
- Support for WCA puzzles other than 3x3
- UI enhancements (e.g. scramble visualisation)

### Flathub

Coming soon to Flathub!
