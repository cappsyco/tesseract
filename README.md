### Current state

We're still early in the life of this app, so features are a bit thin on the ground. Currently we have:

- Generate scrambles for any of the standard WCA cube puzzles (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6 and7x7)
- Time your solves
- View your solving record and AO5, 12 and 100, which persists across multiple sessions
- Delete individual solves or the whole record for that puzzle

### Future features

In order of priority:

- Allow organising your solving into separate sessions
- Support for WCA puzzles other than the standard cubes
- UI enhancements (e.g. scramble visualisation)

### Build & install

Clone this repo and run these commands in its root:

```
just build-release
just install
```
